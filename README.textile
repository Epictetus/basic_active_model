h1. BasicActiveModel

BasicActiveModel provides a minimal architecture for a model that may be used in Rails forms.
It does not provide any kind of implementation. It may be used to create static models (search, contact us, etc.).

It includes ActiveModel validations and may be initialized with an argument Hash with optional mass assignment security.

Please take a look of the specs for more information...
